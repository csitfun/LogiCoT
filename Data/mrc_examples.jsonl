    "input": "\nPassage: A professional baseball team manager, in order to have the funds to sign a new second-baseman, discreetly arranged to trade one of the most popular outfielders on the team for a lesser-known player and an undisclosed amount of money. The manager secretly considered the outfielder to be overrated and overpaid. Reporters forcefully criticized the trade, arguing that the team had lost its best player and that the manager had violated his fiduciary duties to the team and the fans. A few weeks after being traded, the outfielder was retraded, for twice the value received by the original team manager. Plainly, the outfielder' s price shows that the reporters' criticism of the manager' s action was accurate.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is vulnerable to the criticism that the argument does which one of the following?\nA. The argument bases its conclusion on what the best decision is for the present on uncertain projections about what the best decision will be for the future.\nB. The argument rejects a well-established way of achieving an end without explaining why an unconventional way is better suited for achieving the end.\nC. The argument ignores the opinions of expert reporters in the field of baseball when there is no superior source of information.\nD. The argument bases its conclusion on facts that could, considering the circumstances, have been the product of circumstances other than those presumed by the argument's proponents.\nAnswer and reasoning step by step:",
    "output": "D. D. The argument bases its conclusion on facts that could, considering the circumstances, have been the product of circumstances other than those presumed by the argument's proponents.\n\nReasoning: The passage argues that the reporters' criticism of the manager's decision was accurate because the outfielder was retraded for twice the value. However, this change in the outfielder's value could be due to various factors other than the manager's poor decision-making, such as market fluctuations, the outfielder's performance, or the demands of other teams. The argument does not consider these other possible circumstances when concluding that the manager's decision was wrong."

Therefore, the correct answer is A."

    "input": "\nPassage: Some scientists believe that 65 million years ago an asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, thereby causing extinction of the dinosaurs. These scientists have established that such a strike could have hurled enough debris into the atmosphere to block sunlight and cool the atmosphere. Without adequate sunlight, food sources for herbivorous dinosaurs would have disappeared, and no dinosaurs could have survived a prolonged period of low temperatures. These same scientists, however, have also established that most debris launched by the asteroid would have settled to the ground within six months, too soon for the plants to disappear or the dinosaurs to freeze.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the scientists' beliefs and the scientists' results, as described above?\nA. Dinosaurs were susceptible to fatal respiratory problems caused by contamination of the air by asteroid debris.\nB. A cloud of debris capable of diminishing sunlight by 20 percent would have cooled the earth's surface by 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.\nC. Loss of the herbivorous dinosaurs would have deprived the carnivorous dinosaurs of their food source.\nD. Dinosaurs inhabited most landmasses on the planet but were not especially abundant in the area of the asteroid strike.\nAnswer and reasoning step by step:",
    "output": "A. A. This option provides a reason for the dinosaurs' extinction that is not dependent on the disappearance of plants or a prolonged period of low temperatures. With fatal respiratory problems caused by asteroid debris, the extinction of dinosaurs could have happened within the six-month timeline. Therefore, the answer is A."

    "input": "\nPassage: The five senses have traditionally been viewed as distinct yet complementary. Each sense is thought to have its own range of stimuli that are incapable of stimulating the other senses. However, recent research has discovered that some people taste a banana and claim that they are tasting blue, or see a color and say that it has a specific smell. This shows that such people, called synesthesiacs, have senses that do not respect the usual boundaries between the five recognized senses.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nA. Recent evidence strongly suggests that there are other senses besides sight, touch, smell, hearing, and taste.\nB. Synesthesiacs can be temporarily rid of their synesthetic experiences by the use of drugs.\nC. The particular ways in which sensory experiences overlap in synesthesiacs follow a definite pattern.\nD. Synesthesiacs demonstrate a general, systematic impairment in their ability to use and understand words.\nAnswer and reasoning step by step:",
    "output": "D. D. The argument claims that synesthesiacs have senses that don't respect the boundaries between the five recognized senses. If synesthesiacs demonstrate a general, systematic impairment in their ability to use and understand words, then it weakens the argument that their senses are crossing boundaries because it could be a language or communication issue rather than a sensory issue."

Designating land as a wilderness area does not necessarily violate the multiple-use philosophy, for even when such use does not provide the greatest dollar return, it can provide the greatest overall benefit from that site.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?\nA. The multiple-use philosophy takes into account some nonfinancial needs of the public.\nB. Natural resources should be used in combinations that will most greatly benefit present and future generations.\nC. The present and future needs of the public would best be met by designating greater numbers of wilderness areas.\nD. Designating a wilderness area prevents any exploitation of natural resources in that area.\nAnswer and reasoning step by step:",
    "output": "A. A. The multiple-use philosophy takes into account some nonfinancial needs of the public.\n\nReasoning: The passage states that designating land as a wilderness area does not necessarily violate the multiple-use philosophy, even when it does not provide the greatest dollar return, because it can still provide the greatest overall benefit. This implies that the multiple-use philosophy considers not only financial aspects but also nonfinancial needs of the public."

    "input": "\nPassage: The Ergonomic Society conducted a study that indicated that many people develop severe back problems during adulthood, and that virtually all such people who received chiropractic treatment showed great improvement. Ttherefore, in order to minimize the proportion of the population that suffers from back pain, the Ergonomic Society recommended that chiropractic treatment be directed toward those adults who suffer from severe back problems.\nQuestion: Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nA. Severe back pain and other problems often cause individuals to miss workdays.\nB. Chiropractic treatment is more effective in treating severe back problems when utilized over a long period of time, as opposed to sporadically.\nC. Individuals who receive chiropractic or other treatment prior to developing severe back problems are not less likely to develop back pain than those who do not.\nD. Any person who receives chiropractic treatment for back pain may also benefit from other forms of treatment.\nAnswer and reasoning step by step:",
    "output": "C. C. The argument assumes that treating individuals before they develop severe back problems would not be more effective in minimizing the proportion of the population suffering from back pain than focusing on treating those who already have severe back problems."
