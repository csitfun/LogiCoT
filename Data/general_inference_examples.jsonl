Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: ¬Spill(peter) ∧ ¬OnlyChild(peter)\n\n- ¬Spill(peter) → ¬Foodie(peter) (contrapositive of 2)\n- ¬OnlyChild(peter) → ¬BusyParents(peter) (contrapositive of 4)\n- ¬BusyParents(peter) → ¬HighIncome(peter) (contrapositive of 5)\n\nIn this case, we have ¬Foodie(peter) ∧ ¬HighIncome(peter), which matches the second part of the statement we want to infer.\n\nThus, we can infer (Foodie(peter) ∧ HighIncome(peter)) ∨ ¬Foodie(peter) ∧ ¬HighIncome(peter), as we have shown that one of the disjunctions, ¬Foodie(peter) ∧ ¬HighIncome(peter), is true based on the given premises."
